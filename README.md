# About Goodbye Fresh

Created by Team Ravenclaw [Patrick Sullivan](https://github.com/patrick-j-sulley), [Zoe Joblin](https://github.com/zoe-joblin), [Jo Tregidga](https://github.com/jo-tree), [Tim Soikie](https://github.com/tim-soikie), and [Matthew Hocking](https://github.com/Matthew-Hocking) for the one of many 1 day group projects within the web development bootcamp at Enspiral Dev Academy.

Goodbye Fresh is a randomizer web app that allows the user to input their location, to which they are then able to generate a random open takeaway resturant within a 5km distance. The app uses the [Nearby Search API within the Google Maps Places API package](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search-nearby?hl=en_US) for all GET & POST routes.

Goodbye Fresh was developed with a stack of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.JS, and Express.
